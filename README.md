Herman's Change:


1. Dots Ring Enhancement

I increased the number of dots in the dots ring type and added simple alternating colours to create a richer and more varied ring pattern.

2. Solid Ring Converted to Dashed Line

I modified the solid ring type by replacing its continuous stroke with a clean, evenly spaced dashed outline.

3. Dashed Outer Outline for Wheels

I changed the outer boundary of each wheel from a solid circle to a uniform dashed outline to improve visual clarity.

4. Added a Center Core Circle

I added a coloured central circle inside each wheel to emphasize the wheel’s focal point and better reflect the reference artwork.

5. Added Dark-Tone Colours to All Palettes

I expanded each colour palette with a dark-tone colour to improve contrast and unify shadows and outlines across the generated shapes.

6. Connector Colour Improvement

I updated the connector colour to be selected from the wheel’s palette for better visual consistency.
